    <h2>About</h2>
    <p> The center of the geodynamics and seismology take multiple forms, but we act under one overarching mission: pursuing the highest standard geophysics study while maintaining a dynamics and inclusive group culture. As its name implies, our works mostly focuses on two major aspects of the field of geophysics: seismology and geodynamics. XXXXXX about seismologic work we do here; XXXXX about geodynamics we do here.</p>

    <p>Outstanding questions remain about the thermomechanical processes involved in the extensional collapse of the North American Southwest Cordillera, including the evolution of thermal input, crustal fluids and melts, topographic change, and plate tectonic and mantle flow evolution.  Low upper mantle seismic wave speeds, together with active volcanism, are insufficient to predict rapid lithospheric strain rates in the southwestern United States.  Instead, in addition to the slow upper mantle wave speeds and volcanism, the lithosphere is characterized by abundant geothermal waters, enriched in F and 3He (indicating mantle fluid sources), which predicts rapid lithospheric strain.  Belts of fluorspar deposits, which are associated with highly extended zones, are therefore likely to be precipitates of paleofluids emplaced during times of rapid transtensional crustal strain.  The proposed work will test this hypothesis by using U/Pb and (U/Th)/He dating combined witha high resolution time-dependent thermomechanical model.  Furthermore, 40Ar/39Ar dating of associated sericite and alunite deposits will provide validation and confidence in the fluorite dating methods.  Thermomechanical model outputs will be compared with geologic, thermochronologic, sedimentologic, and geophysical observations.  The proposed thermomechanical modeling will 1) quantify the causes and consequences of the topographic changes of the study area by modeling the collapse of the Nevada-plano and Arizona-plano; 2) identify the mechanisms for lithospheric weakening, including the role of thermal and magmatic evolution; 3) provide direct tectonic context for deformation and seismic hazards within the modern Basin and Range Province; and 4) integrate the latest seismic results from the Earthscope project by incorporating seismic, thermal, and compositional information of the lithospheric-asthenosphere system.  Metamorphic core complex formation is hypothesized to be linked to collapse of highlands, but to date no 3-D models have directly addressed the effects of body forces set up by realistic topography.  Methods developed for this propsal are poised to address the physics of the development of the core complexes as well as the structurale evolution of the Basin and Range in the context of the inferred timing of rhealogical weakening informed by fluorspar dating. The novel approach to dating fluorspar, together with the integrated thermomechanical modeling plan, can be applied to other regions of the world where fluorspar deposits are associated with extensional zones.  The proposed collaborative work explores the cutting edge linkage between critical mineral formation and the 3-D evolution of the dynamics of the Southwest Cordillera.</p>
